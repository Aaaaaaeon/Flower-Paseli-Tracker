## 📖 About

**Flower Paseli Tracker** allows arcade rhythm game players to easily audit their spending history. By running directly in your browser's console, it safely scrapes your transaction history pages to calculate:

*   💰 **Total PASELI redeemed**
*   💶 **Estimated real currency cost** (default: 100p = 1€)
*   📈 **Average transaction value**
*   🔝 **Largest & Smallest single transactions**
*   🎶 **Statistics on each game**

No installation or browser extension is required. The script runs locally in your session and sends no data externally.
